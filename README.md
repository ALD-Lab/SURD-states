# Decomposition of causality by states

_A Python repository for decomposing synergistic, unique, and redundant causalities by states._

## Getting started

After cloning the repository, you can set up the environment needed to run the scripts successfully by following the instructions below. You can create an environment using `conda` with all the required packages by running:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
